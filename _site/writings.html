      <p><p>Now that you have some experience with a text editor, another tool that is crucial for you to understand is systemctl. Systemctl is the command line wrapper around systemd which is how processes and programs are normally made to run, and are started and stopped by the administrator.</p>

<p>The example process that we’ll be using in the demonstration is the firewall manager firewalld. Now, there are a couple main things that you can use systemctl for. To check the status of a running package, you just type:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">systemctl status firewalld</code></p>

<p>Which will give you the last few lines of the log file for the service, and a direct message about whether it’s running or not. If you want a service to start, it’s simply:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">systemctl start firewalld</code></p>

<p>And similarly stopping a service is:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">systemctl stop firewalld</code></p>

<p>The last real command that you need to use is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">enable</code> flag which just makes it so that the process starts when the server reboots. So normally the sequence that you follow when adding a new service is:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">systemctl start firewalld &amp;&amp; systemctl enable firewalld &amp;&amp;systemctl status firewalld</code></p>

<p>Which to recap just starts the service, tells it to start on login, and then shows the status to ensure that it is running. Oh, and I almost forgot there is an alias flag <code class="highlighter-rouge">restart</code> that basically stops the service and then starts it. The main reason that you’ll be starting and stopping services in the future is to have them relaunch with new config changes.</p>

      <p><p>Vim. That simple word can bring forth any emotion from love to hatred and even confusion for those that have used it before. What is it? Well, according to our man page, vim is Vi IMproved, a programmer’s text editor.  Now, you may be wondering what it means to be a programmer’s text editor, or why we would even need a text editor on our server.</p>

<p>If you remember back to our first day with the ssh keys, we’ve actually already used vi, which is what vim is built upon, to create a file. Creating and editing files directly on the server saves you, the user, the trouble of having to copy the file to your local machine, edit it, and then upload it back to the server. Instead, we can just simply edit it directly where it lives. This allows you to make changes quicker and continue on with what you need to be doing.</p>

<p>That’s all good and well, but you may be asking why I would choose vim. The answers pretty simple actually. Vi, the slightly more simplistic version of vim has all of the same keybindings and comes installed on pretty much any linux, unix, or bsd variant made in the last twenty years. This means that if you have to edit a file on a machine that is unable to update or install packages for whatever reason you can still edit files as an editor that you know is going to be there for you to rely on.</p>

<p>In the coming tutorials I am going to be giving commands for you to use, and all of the file based commands will use vim. Instead of having to explain the commands every single post, it’s easier to have a base list for you to refer to. So, you may be expecting there to be a list of commands in a table below, with each telling you what it does. For this though I am actually going to take the easy route and direct you to a tutorial.</p>

<p>Not just any tutorial though, but the vim tutor. The vim tutor is a program that ships with every version of vim and walks you through how to use vim by having you actually use vim to edit the tutorial itself. Before throwing you directly into it though, one thing about vim needs to be explained. Vim is a modal editor. That means that there exists multiple states that you can be in when using the editor, and in vim when in different modes the keys of your keyboard will actually do different things depending on what mode you are.</p>

<p>When you launch vim you start in editing mode. If you try to type directly into the document, other things will happen. While this may seem confusing, this is actually where vim gains most of its power. An example of this power can be seen in two keystrokes. While in edit mode, if the cursor is at the beginning of a word and you type:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">dw</code></p>

<p>That will delete the entire word. Now imagine that the word that you wanted to delete was something long like the word administration. You could either hit the delete key for each letter, or simply type two letters and delete the entire word. To switch to input mode, where as you guessed it you can input text, you simply type:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code></p>

<p>And to exit back to editing mode you simply hit the:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">escape</code></p>

<p>key. If this seems interesting, then follow the instructions below to begin. And if it doesn’t, I still encourage you to give it a try. You never know when it might come in handy to know even just the basics of vim. To install vim run:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo yum install vim -y</code></p>

<p>And to launch the tutor just run:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">vimtutor</code></p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

      <h4><a href="/writing/2018/02/21/Basic-Server_Administration-3.html">Basic Server Administration - Day 3</a></h4>
      <p><p>Yesterday before we installed screen I briefly mentioned a program on your server called man, and glossed over what the program actually does. So today, we’re going to learn about man and why it should be the first thing you do when using a new command.</p>

<p>A good first step is to run the command on itself. To follow along, that would be:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">man man</code></p>

<p>Which will pop open a new screen that gives a description for the man command. The first entry is the name of the command, which includes the command that you type at the terminal and a brief description of what it does. When learning a new command this is very handy, as the description can save you a google on it’s own.</p>

<p>Following the name is a synopsis of the command. This is useful as it show a shorthand of the various options that can be used with the command. After that, there is a roughly paragraph long description of the command that just expands upon the shorter bit above. The last bit of useful information is the options section. This lists each command line flag that the command can take, and gives a description of what the flag does to the command.</p>

<p>As an exercise to learn man and yum, your next task is to use man to find the command line option to search the yum repositories for the rsync command, then attach to your update screen and install the rsync command there. I’ll give the command at the start of the post for tomorrow.</p>

      <p><p>Now that you can log on to your server with ease, the next thing that we want to do is make sure that it is always up to date. But before we do that I want to just briefly explain how user sessions work for your server. When you log in to your server using the ssh command from yesterday, the server opens a session for your user account.</p>

<p>You can open multiple sessions this way by either logging on from multiple computers or simply opening a new terminal window and logging in again. This session persists until you either exit the server or close your browser window. Now, why is this important to bring up when learning about keeping your server up to date? Well, put simply having your session end while your server is updating is the number one way to ruin your operating system.</p>

<p>Since this can happen if you accidentally close your terminal window or even just lose wifi, then it makes sense to take measures to ensure that this doesn’t happen to you. One way, and what I would argue is the easiest way, is to install a program called screen. A brief description from screen’s man page:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Name: screen - screen manager with VT100/ANSI terminal emulation</code></p>

<p>For a more detailed overview you can read the man page, more detail on what that actually is tomorrow, but in essence, screen allows you to have multiple background sessions running on the server. This means that if you do your updating in this background session, then it can never end unless the server gets shut off which helps ensure that your server doesn’t get ruined.</p>

<p>To install screen, log on to the server and run the following command:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo yum install screen -y</code></p>

<p>Which will install screen onto the server using the default package manager for centos. Now that it’s installed we can launch a screen session using:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">screen</code></p>

<p>This will launch you into a new session. Now, to leave the session running in the background run:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">control+a+d</code></p>

<p>And to rejoin the session:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">screen -r</code></p>

<p>And now that we’re back in the session, to fully update the server run:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo yum update -y</code></p>

<p>And after watching all of the text fly across the screen, type the leave command at any point to let that update run in the background and you can go on your merry way. From now on, every time that you need to update your software or install a new package just re-attach to that screen session and run it there. Tomorrow we’ll take a look at learning the man command through diving deep to learn more about the yum and screen commands that we used today.</p>

      <h4><a href="/writing/2018/02/18/Basic-Server-Admin-1.html">Basic Server Administration - Day 1</a></h4>
      <p><p>After yesterdays post about who should be learning server administration, it’s time to actually start learning. The first step is to get yourself a linux machine and install Centos 7 on it, as that is what we will be using throughout this. With most hosting providers this is simply an option that you select when you’re signing up. The other required technologies are a computer running Mac OS, as that is what I use day to day so that’s the easiest for me to test.</p>

<p>The first thing that you will probably do with your server is want to get onto it, normally through ssh. The command for this on your Mac is:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">ssh username@ip.ad.dr.ess</code></p>

<p>After you type that, you should receive a prompt on your screen asking you for your password. Now, because you will be doing this frequently, or at least you should be to be properly learning, typing the password every time will quickly become tiresome. So we’re going to use key based authentication. Key based authentication works by generating a public key and a private key that work together. What this means is when you try to log onto a server, your laptop is going to hand your private key to the server, and if it matches with one that the server has in its key list then you can logon without using a password.</p>

<p>To start this process, on terminal on your mac type the following:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">ssh-keygen -t RSA</code></p>

<p>which means that we will be generating an ssh key with the RSA encryption scheme. If you choose you can enter a password when prompted, and you should save it within the default location. Then type</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy</code></p>

<p>which just copies the public portion of the key that was just created to the system clipboard. Then ssh to the server using the ssh command from above, and do the following:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">mkdir .ssh</code></p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">vi .ssh/authorized_keys</code></p>

<p>Now we are in a command line text editor named vi, which will seem extremely confusing at first, and we’ll get into it one day but for now just hit the <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code> key, hit <code class="highlighter-rouge">command+v</code> to paste the public key from your clipboard, hit the <code class="highlighter-rouge">esc</code> key on your keyboard, then type <code class="highlighter-rouge">:wq</code> and you’re out. Now just to quickly breeze through the wizardry that we just went through, we went into <strong>i</strong>nsert to put text into the file, pasted the text into the file, <strong>esc</strong>aped from insert mode, and then <strong>w</strong>rote the file and <strong>q</strong>uit from the file.</p>

<p>Now to try this out type</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">quit</code></p>

<p>which will have you leave the server. Then if we did everything right, after trying to ssh again, that command from the top, you should be able to log into the server without using your password. Again, this seems like a little thing but trust me it will be very helpful going forward.</p>

      <h4><a href="/writing/2018/02/17/Who-Should-Learn-Server-Administration.html">Should You Learn Server Administration?</a></h4>
      <p><p>So, I’ve been asked by a few people both at work and school about who should learn server administration. While I am by no means an expert at administrating servers, I do keep a healthy homelab of between fifteen and twenty servers and I help maintain roughly the same amount of servers here at my day job so I do have some basic knowledge. I will try to outline a few people who should look into this, and also a few reasons as to why they should.</p>

<p>The first group of people that may be curious about server administration are those who are looking to either switch careers from something else into server administration or those who are looking to make the jump from help desk, or related, to being an administrator. While being a server administrator is not the easiest role in the world, knowing the basics is certainly doable for the average person interested in technology. The second group of people would be developers looking to launch a website or other online service, maybe a server component for a mobile application or related, and wish to have control over where that will be hosted.</p>

<p>By following the path of becoming a server administrator one will gain a basic understanding of how the internet operates, as each and every website that you visit throughout the day is run by technologies that are roughly the same as what you will be learning. Once you have learned this information yourself, it will be easy for you to apply among any number of uses, whether that be a virtual machine on your laptop or desktop or even on a hosted virtual private server (VPS) hosted at a hosting provider. The only difference between the two are where the machine is located.</p>

<p>For those simply looking to become server administrators, that means that this knowledge will be easily transferrable among any company that you wish to work for. Those developers looking to launch their own site will reap greater benefit as it will allow you to host your site with any hosting provider, so you can jump between them until you find the right mix of price and customer support as you see fit. This lack of provider tie in becomes even more important when the developer realizes that they don’t have to host everything under the sun with AWS. There is nothing wrong with hosting services on AWS, but one can normally save time, money and stress by being able to host their site on any old box that runs linux.</p>

<p>I am continually amazed by the amount of classmates that I talk to that don’t even realize there is another option to hosting a website that isn’t on the platform provided by AWS. They are even more amazed to learn how simply having one load balancer and two web servers behind it sets them up to scale almost infinitely for a time. While there are limitations to that, trust me by the time that you hit them you should easily be making enough money from your site or service that upgrading from that setup can be the problem of someone that you hire.</p>

<p>Considering the above benefits of learning a new skill for career advancement or ease of launching a new project, for anyone even thinking about starting to learn server administration the answer should be a resounding yes. Over the next few days and weeks I’ll be putting together a series of posts that will allow one to begin the path of server administration by starting with a blank VPS and getting to the point of having a secure one page website. Now, what can one do with one page site? They can have it be a simple resume site, or even turn it into a bunch of pages kind of like the blog that you are currently reading. Neat, huh?</p>

      <h4><a href="/writing/2018/02/12/Found-Vs-Made-Photography.html">Found Vs Made Photography</a></h4>
      <p><p>There is a common misconception today that photography as an art form is a medium akin to painting or drawing, thus allowing the photographer to share their vision of the world with those who view the work. While it is true that viewing a photo does allow one to see how the world appears to the artist, there is no reason to believe that the artist is creating that world. Considering other mediums of art, using painting as an example, when the artist sets out to capture their subject exactly as how it is seen, the subject can often appear different in the final product. That’s not to say that the artist set out to modify the subject, however it is often unavoidable. For example, when painting a flower, there are a few things that can be changed from reality without the artist noticing. The easiest of these for others to see would be the color of the flower, for even if the artist matches the color they see entirely accurately there is no guarantee that the color is true to how others perceive it. Again, this is not a mistake made by the artist, it is simply the reality of relying on the human eye to accurately detect color.</p>

<p>In contrast, when using a camera with sufficient technology this is impossible as the camera will capture the true color of the object regardless of what it’s operator sees. One of the wonders of photography though is that through the magic of post-processing, either digital or analog, it is possible for the artist to change how the colors or even subjects appear within the photo. This single aspect distinguishes photography as being different as it allows for two different categories of photography to exist, that of the found image and that of the made image.</p>

<p>The found image is often what most photographers start with when they first begin taking photos. A found image is one that represents what the artist saw in front of them at the time of hitting the shutter, but also relies upon the content of the photo having been there before the photographer decided to take the image. Many start here as it is relatively easy to just walk around capturing images of what’s in front of you. That is not to say though, that capturing a good found image is easy; This requires being in the right place at the right time, and for the photographer to have a sense of how the image will look before taking it.</p>

<p>Arguably the most well-known form of found photography is street photography. The image of a photographer walking the streets of a big city and snapping pictures of the interesting things going on around them is a familiar one to anyone that’s paid attention to photography. This is also the style of photography that was common in the mid twentieth century, as it allowed those that lived within New York City to share the wonders of the big city with those in America who didn’t. As the street photographer must act quickly to capture the events unfolding around them, there is little room for them to make the images into something they aren’t.</p>

<p>The other well-known genre of found photography is landscape photography, where exactly as it sounds the photographer goes out and captures the landscape in front of them. This can be anything from a sweeping mountain range to a lush forest or a city off in the distance. It’s with these images though where a beginner photographer may start drifting into made photography. Most people when trying to make their photography better delve into learning how to “post-process” their images. In landscape photography, one may not see it as a big deal to simply make the green of the trees a little greener, or the water in the lake a little blue-er, however by doing so they are manipulating the image to be different from what the naked eye sees.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with photographers doing this, it is simply good to note that when doing so a photographer moves from showing his surroundings to showing how he perceives his surroundings. Another slight crossover genre of photography is that of the portrait photographer. While one may start taking photos of those around them in natural light, doing so may lead the photographer to look into using extra light which changes the image. Or a photographer’s client may request that the photographer remove imperfections within the image such as stray hairs or acne, which while helpful to the subject does change the image.</p>

<p>This is not to say that lighting or changing the images in post is the only way to “make” and image. Regarding portrait photography again, there are many things the photographer can change before taking the picture that moves the image towards the made end of the spectrum including having the subject of the photograph go to certain locations, having them wear certain clothes or makeup, or even changing who the subject is. This can then go even further if the photographer chooses to, mostly through post processing. Using Photoshop or one of its many competitors for post processing is what truly allows the photographer to delve into the made photography spectrum, as using these programs allow skilled artists to manipulate the images in almost any way that they choose. This can be anything from changing colors to removing items in the frame to adding items to the frame, all of which allow the artist to show us their view of the world rather than just the world.</p>

<p>Both of found and made photography have their place within the world, and neither is initially better than the other. Without having both, the world of photography would be a much simpler and more boring world, and the art scene would be without some of the major game changers within the medium.</p>

      <h4><a href="/writing/2018/02/09/DFA-for-Regex.html">Constructing A DFA From A Regex</a></h4>
      <p><p>While creating <a href="https://doug-skinner.com/projects/2018/02/09/Prex.html">Prex</a>,
one of the major challenges was trying to figure out the best way to represent a
walkable path through the regular expression without just resorting to the built in regular
expression class within Python. After some deliberation, and a failed attempt of
trying to keep track of my position walking through the string iteself, I
remembered from my Automata class that a regular expression has to be able to be
represented within a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton">Deterministic Finite Automaton</a> or it’s
not valid, so I decided to construct one of those. In order to do this, I would
need three classes, one to represent each state of the DFA, one to represent the
actual DFA, and then one to read in the file and the regex string to be
processed. Since the actual code for the project can be found both on my personal GitLab
and Github I won’t be showing the actual code here, just describing the thought
process.</p>

<p>Creating the state representation was relatively simple. It has three
internal variables, one to hold any possible loop variables, one to hold any
possible transition variables, and then one to represent the next state. The
reason for that last variable is to represent the possible states as a linked
list of states, to easily keep track of the beginning and end of the list. In
order to create the DFA from the regex, a blank state is created initially.
Then, for each character a new state is created, the transition variable is set
to the character, and then the previous state’s next state is set to the current
state.</p>

<p>The only exception to this is if the character is +, *, [, or ]. If the
character is a +, which means that the character can appear one or many times,
then a new state is added with a loop variable that matches the previous states
transition variable and the transition variable is set to ‘’. Aside, in this DFA
a transition of ‘’ is treated as a null transition allowing it to be
transitioned across at any time. If the character is a *, which means that the character can be there zero or
any number of times, the previous characters transition variable is moved to the
loop variable, and the transition variable is set to ‘’. This allows it to be
looped infinitely or skipped entirely.</p>

<p>The last part of the construction is if the character is a [. If it is, then a
flag is set indicating that we are currently within brackets. While that flag is
set, all characters encountered are added to the transition variable of the
current state. Once we encounter a ], we turn that flag off and continue. And
thus, the DFA is made and we can start processing the passed in strings.</p>

any topic that my little heart desired, as long as it related to the class. The
topic was copyright law in the online realm, and what follows is the paper. Enjoy.</p>

<hr />

<p>Currently there is a conversation ongoing within the United States about stealing. This discussion however, isn’t about the theft of physical property. The discussion is instead focused on the common act among internet users of copying and sharing files and whether that should be considered stealing according to United States law. Currently according to the United States Code, Title 17: Sections 501 and 506 (17 U.S. Code § 506), any unauthorized copying is against federal law, and the law prescribes severe civil and criminal penalties for the act. This law, and the punishments defined within are based on treating the digital copying of files, called digital theft, the same as physical theft. Based on the actions of most individuals within society however, the argument can and should be made to not treat the actions as equivalent.</p>

<p>According to Reynolds, intellectual property is the “term used to describe works of the mind—such as art, books, films, formulas, inventions, music, and processes—that are distinct and owned or created by a single person or group.” (Reynolds, G. 2014). This intellectual property is governed through various governments through copyright, patent, and trade secret laws. The two sets of laws that most frequently govern the acts of copying online files are copyright laws and patent laws, protecting art, books, film, and music or inventions respectively. According to Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8 congress shall have the power “to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Rights to their respective Writings and Discoveries.” (Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8. 2000). Also, according to Reynolds, a copyright is the “exclusive right to distribute, display, perform, or reproduce an original work in copies or to prepare derivative works based on the work.” (Reynolds, G. 2014). Any person found to be in violation of the rights held by a copyright holder is committing copyright infringement. According to current United States law the courts have much ability to pursue or make example cases of copyright infringement, as they have the power to award fines anywhere from $200 to $100,000. Current copyright law guarantees the holder to the rights to their work for a period of several years.</p>

<p>At the bidding of lobbyists from those who stand to gain a lot by extending copyright, the term of copyright has been extended 11 times in the timespan starting in 1960. The people primarily behind the lobbyists are mostly movie studios and other large holders of multiple copyrights to merchandising empires. The reason behind fighting so hard for copyright extensions is that the studios make most of their profit from selling toys, movies, and other tie-ins for their various iconic properties.</p>

<p>The original term of copyright was twenty-eight years, however the Copyright Term Extension Act signed into law in 1998 sets out the time limits outlined as follows (COPYRIGHT TERM EXTENSION):</p>

<ul>
  <li>For works created after January 1, 1978, copyright protections endure for the life of the author plus 70 years.</li>
  <li>For works created but not published or registered before January 1, 1978, the term endures the life of the author plus 70 years, but also guarantees that it expires no earlier than December 31, 2004.</li>
  <li>For works created before 1978 that are still within their original term of copyright the total term is to be extended to 95 years from the original date of copyright.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once this act was signed into law, it was challenged by Eric Eldred. Eldred wanted to create an online library of sorts, where older books would be available for viewing to those who otherwise wouldn’t have access to them. The Eldred v. Ashcroft case went all the way to the United States Supreme Court, which upheld the act as constitutional in 2003. After the Supreme Court made this decision, many internet activists revolted against it, not unlike what occurred during the attempted passing of PIPA and SOPA in 2012. The activists attempted to get Congress to change the law through appeals directly to its members, and even started a campaign to amend the Constitution (Wu, T. 2003). Other members of the internet activist groups however fought to fix this wrong doing another way. The activists argued that as they had the power to write code to either enforce the law or allow it to be broken easier, that power should be used to directly influence the publics conformance or not with the law. While that is not to say that the activists directly encouraged the breaking of the law, it can be stated that the like great tax lawyers can find loopholes within the tax code, great programmers and activists should likewise look to exploit the copyright protections within any possible legal loopholes (Wu, T. 2003). Thus, semi-organized resistance to copyright law was discussed for the first time regarding the digital realm.</p>

<p>One of the major defenses used by these activists, and unfortunately those who do go on to break the law, is the concept of the Fair Use Doctrine. Renyold’s defines it as “allowing portions of copyrighted materials to be used without permission under certain circumstances.” (Reynolds, G. 2014). The United States Code, according to Title 17 Section 107 states that “the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.” (17 U.S. Code § 107). The law also outlines the following four considerations to use when determining whether a specific use of a copyrighted work falls within fair use.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;</li>
  <li>The nature of the copyrighted work;</li>
  <li>The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole;</li>
  <li>Finally, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.</li>
</ul>

<p>The law also concludes by stating that the above guidelines are to be used whether the copyrighted work is published or not.</p>

<p>An application of the Fair Use Doctrine in 2011 was when the HathiTrust Digital Library had a lawsuit filed against them by the Authors Guild, an advocacy group for writers. The reasoning behind the lawsuit was that multiple digital copies of a work or text were created through the simple act of building the library, that HathiTrust Digital Library was violating copyright by reproducing copyrighted works without the explicit permission of each copyright holder. While the courts did eventually side with the library, stating that by transferring the works from a written form to digital form the library was falling under transformative use, an all too common counter point to this ruling is the continued prosecution of those who share music or other forms of media digitally.</p>

<p>In the book “What if We Could Re-Imagine Copyright”, Christophe Geiger argued that copyright protections are key to the continued survival of many forms of creative expression (Geiger, C. 2017). While Geiger does acknowledge that copyrights are mostly beneficial for large corporations, he still argues for the continued use of copyright. The argument can be made that artists will be loath to continue producing content without the knowledge that their work will be free from copying, however in modern times it seems that this is no longer the case. This can be seen in the large number of people creating songs, videos, and other creations and either open-sourcing the contents or uploading them to platforms where the platform owner holds the ownership of the content. This counter-argument can then be extended to considering if people are willing to give up ownership of a work entirely, that there should be no qualms about the sharing of their content to new audiences.</p>

<p>Once someone follows this train of thought, it begs the question of whether copying digital bits to a friend is ethical instead of illegal. Once taken out of the realm of legality into the realm of everyday thought, it seems remarkable that this conversation has even continued in the days of easy access to everything online. While the law unfairly equivocates downloading a copyrighted work with common law stealing, what should be considered the more important question to an individual that is about to commit this act is how a group of their peers, also known as a jury, would see this action. The reason this is important is that while the laws of a country are seemingly set in stone, in most developed countries it is the will of the people, again that group of your peers, that can help shape and change the way the law works. This process of change allows the laws to be continually updated to reflect what society considers to be unethical.</p>

<p>Before the topic can be discussed, a brief description on the difference between illegal (legal) and unethical (ethical) is necessary. Legal means something recognized or made effective by a court of law as distinguished from a court of equity, whereas ethics is defined as the moral principles of an individual. Defined in plain English, for an action to be illegal it must be against a written law, whereas an action must be considered immoral to a person to be ethically wrong. Now, a definition of moral, sanctioned by one’s conscience, will be helpful here. While legality is based on written laws which are notoriously hard to change in the United States no matter how easy that should be, ethicality is based on one’s own belief of what is right and wrong. And, as can be seen on Wiring the Brain (Mitchell, K. 2011, June 13), the morals of one person come from those around the individual.</p>

<p>Once this fact has been accepted, it is not that far of a jump to conclude how a law is originally created. A law is a cemented moral based upon a specific point in time. As anyone who’s ever watched the American political system flounder to change the laws put into place by the previous administration has learned, laws are difficult to change simply because they are easily defended by those who they protect. What does this mean? Well, it means that while morals evolve based on what a group of people currently think, laws are based upon what a group decided to write down at some point in the past. This means that there is going to naturally be some drift between the two of these points. And due to the difficulty of changing the written laws, the gap only increases over time. So, while everyone can agree, at least within the United States, that downloading content that you don’t currently have an agreement to have access to is illegal the real question is to whether this same act is unethical.</p>

<p>This depends entirely upon what society currently thinks, and I think that the argument can be made that society agrees that downloading is not stealing which goes back to the definition of stealing. The definition of stealing is defined as follows: party A has an item, and party B doesn’t; Party B then takes the item from party A; Now party B has it and party A doesn’t. This is a zero-sum problem, where only one party can have the item at once. That’s why common theft is considered both illegal and unethical as it means that one person’s loss is another person’s gain.</p>

<p>Downloading an item, such as an mp3 file, is not zero sum however. If an mp3 is taken, copied it, and given to another party the first party still has their copy of the mp3 and now someone else does too. This means that both parties have the file, resulting in one person’s gain and another person’s neutral. It should be easy to agree that between having a zero-sum vs a positive sum outcome, the positive sum is more desired. And if the outcome is more desired, there is absolutely no reason that it should be made, or continue to be, against the law. And it seems that most of current American society would agree with me.</p>

<p>(Mick, J. 2013, January 21)</p>

<p>Another argument for the easing of copyright laws is that most great works of history have been derivative in some manner. A derivative work is an expressive creation that includes major elements of an original copyright protected work, without consisting entirely of the original work. According to law, the work must be considered original and bear the marks of the new artist in order to be truly derivative instead of simply copying. While one of the most famous examples of a derivative work, the LHOOQ, is simply a joke consisting of the Mona Lisa painting originally created by Leonardo da Vinci repainted to include a moustache, there is no reason to believe that is the only form of derivative work. Most media that the American public consumes is derivative in some way. Late night comedy shows almost entirely consist of poking fun at the actions of those around them within society, or mocking popular culture elements of TV Shows. Considering TV shows, two of the most popular shows in America Family Guy and The Simpsons are incredibly derivative, as both shows not only have entire characters that are simply parodies of characters, both real and cartoon, but also have entire episodes that consist of making fun of another show or movie.</p>

<p>Examples such as these aren’t limited to TV shows, as movies and books have done the same thing. After the Lord of the Rings became a popular book, the entire genre of fantasy consisting of made up worlds with original languages and creatures that never existed before exploded into popularity. Harry Potter serves as another book that helped to spark the love of fantasy within another generation of society. Similarly, the book Dune is considered a large part of the popularity of Science Fiction, and the entire Star Wars franchise is entirely based off the success of the first movie, A New Hope, that is considered by many critics to be almost an entire rip off of the story from Dune (Kunzru, H. 2015, July 03). Disney, the new owners of Star Wars, are not unfamiliar with the concept of derivative works themselves, as most of their popular movies are based on simply taking stories from the Fairy Tales Grimm, making them appropriate for children by taking out references to death, murder, and the gruesome bits, and marketing them as if they were originally created by Disney.</p>

<p>Going back to original example of the LHOOQ, most painters are very derivative as they grow upon the designs and ideas of those that came before them. Or, sometimes this takes the shape of going the other direction. An artist may consume so much of one type of media only to ensure that they go the entirely opposite direction to be original. However, originality only for the sake of not being derivative can be even be considered derivation itself as you must consume enough of a topic to make sure that your implementation doesn’t include anything that’s in the original. Finally, probably the most derivative genre of media of all is music, for many of the same reasons as painting. Music goes even further as many of the most popular songs nowadays are nothing more than rehashes of those that came before. An example recently in the news was when one rap artist produced a song, a second rap artist then remixed that song into another using the first as a hook. The original artist then took the song created by the second and used it as a hook for a third song. Creating a song of a song of a song is something that is only possible according to current societal morals as both artists didn’t care that the other took their work as it is commonplace among the music community. There is no reason that the same can’t be said for other communities.</p>

<p>Information is power (Swartz , A. 2008, July). Many in history have said that before, and many will say it in the years to come. However, like all power in society there are those that want to make it so that they remain in power by keeping information, knowledge about everything within society to themselves. A perfect example of this is anyone who wants to read previous scientific and cultural research on a topic. This information is being increasingly held by a handful of private companies, that want to charge enormously large amounts of money to access that information. It is a sad fact that currently the final step in the research of many doctoral students is to turn in their paper, get it peer reviewed, accepted into the community, and then hand over the keys to the kingdom to those already in power. The knowledge gained is then held by the doctoral student, anyone who read it previously, and now anyone that want to pay online databases roughly a $100 per article for access.</p>

<p>The online database companies take these matters very seriously, even pursuing legal actions against those who try to work around the safeguards that they have in place to stop the spread of knowledge. The most famous of these court cases involving JSTOR, notably the most well-known of the article stores, and a young man named Aaron Swartz. While on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Swartz had started downloading articles from JSTOR. While anyone on the campus has full access to JSTOR using their web portal, Aaron had written a script to simulate browsing the website to download multiple articles at once as fast as the computer could. All told, he got multiple hard drives worth of data for an unknown purpose. Swartz had said that he was using the papers he gathered for research purposes, something that is entirely within the rights of a JSTOR user. JSTOR, however, declared that he must be downloading the articles for the nefarious purpose of trying to open his own competing article database.</p>

<p>Using the copyright laws that were stated within the first couple pages of this article and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, JSTOR brought legal action against Swartz, which involved him getting arrested by an FBI team. This eventually lead Swartz to be charged with multiple felonies and the chance of being ordered to pay restitution of over a million dollars. A million dollars, for what? Downloading some articles that anyone in the world that can make it to Boston can access for free? The prosecution ended abruptly when Aaron was found dead after the case was once again continued. While this may seem like an extreme example, this could become increasingly commonplace if the copyright laws aren’t adjusted to be realistic with the society of today that involves the use of so much online data.</p>

<p>Without completely rehashing the arguments made above, it can be said that the main arguments for the changing of copyright laws are the differences between what is written law and what is believed by the common man, the effect that sharing works on knowledge can have, and how copyright serves to gate-keep that knowledge from those that need it the most. Through the surveys outlined above, it has been proven multiple times that the average person in America either sees no problem with internet piracy or is a pirate themselves. Since most seem okay to commit the act, it is highly doubtful that they believe that they should be prosecuted for breaking a law that is so out of touch with their actions and the actions of those around them. It is also clear to see that many works nowadays and in the past, are derivative in nature, whether that is painters and composers taking inspiration from their peers to the newer fascination that rappers and hip-hop artists have with remixing each other’s songs either adding a new rap verse or taking the chorus of one song to use as the refrain to another. Without the ability to do this, many of these artists would not be able to make the kinds of or amount of music that they currently do. Finally, in this day and age especially considering the number of times that this has gone wrong in the past it is frankly ridiculous that there should be keepers of knowledge. While there should always be libraries to store knowledge, the cost of obtaining that knowledge should be either physically getting to the library or navigating to the libraries webpage, not paying sometimes hundreds of dollars per article to access that information. Every time in history this same setup has occurred of those privileged few with access to all the knowledge leaving the plebeians with starvation of the mind, there has been some catastrophic event that causes the loss of all that knowledge.</p>

<p>Judging the content contained within the body of this article, it should be relatively easy to assume where I stand on the issue, however I think it best to explicitly outline where I stand on the issue now that I have provided ample evidence in support. While an extreme view, even among my peers who spend most of their time within the digital realm, I believe that in the age of the internet copyright is a holdover of the past that is best to be forgotten about like the act of turning in papers written on scrolls or only passing knowledge orally. Personally, I am of the mind that the best works of humanity have yet to exist, will exist only through the continued use of technology, and will never exist if the current copyright system is allowed to continue unchanged.</p>

<p>Following the discussions on this topic outlined above, it certainly seems necessary to rethink or totally abolish the use of copyright when it pertains to works that can and should so easily be shared within society today. The laws that were created and expanded upon before the internet was a commonality should not still be what governs the actions using its power. The world itself is a better place following the dissemination of knowledge and copyright laws only serve to go against the grain of time. Following this discussion, it looks like it might be time to update those laws America.</p>

      <h4><a href="/writing/2018/01/19/Mushroom-Redesign.html">Mushroom Redesign</a></h4>
      <p><p>While browsing reddit the other day I came upon a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/7q8qka/i_made_a_rough_draft_of_a_flask_app_that_accepts/">link</a> to a newer Github repo that someone was working on. That repo was <a href="https://github.com/brettvanderwerff/Mushroom-Map-Maker">Mushroom Map Maker</a> and now, mushrooms aren’t normally my thing, however I always like seeing what others are working on so I thought I would take a look. And functionality was great, the search worked perfectly, and even properly gave errors if the input was missing. The aesthetics of the page however left a little to be desired so I thought I would download it and take a look at what I could do.</p>

<p>The original landing page looked like this:</p>

<p><img class="rounded img-fluid shadow" src="/img/post_images/mushroom_starting_image.png" /></p>

<p>So it was obvious that the creater, <a href="https://github.com/brettvanderwerff">brettvanderwerff</a>, was using bootstrap 3 based on the basic jumbotron and navbar. Now, bootstrap 3 is the older version and using bootstrap 4 would be easier, but it shouldn’t be too hard. Before I begin, I should point at that the changes to the actual repo were all done inline to not include another file in the repository, but will be represented below as if there were an actual custom css file.</p>

<p>The first change that I made was to indicate the actual page the user was using on the navbar, as to begin with it only ever had the active class on the “Home” link. This was as simple as adding a page variable to the flask routing that returned the name of the page, and did an if statement for each link to add the class if necessary. No other visual changes yet.</p>

<p>The next thing that I did was to actually remove the standard active class, and implement my own version at first just changing the color of the link text. I also opted to make the background color of the navbar white instead of the default grey-ish. Our custom css file would look like so:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
.active-link {
  color: blue;
}

.navbar-bg {
  background-color: white;
}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And the landing page now looked like so:</p>

<p><img class="rounded img-fluid shadow" src="/img/post_images/mushroom_new_navbar.png" /></p>

<p>Next, do deal with the actual content of the index page. The content was already within a container, which was good. First I pulled the instructions “Select “Search for a Mushroom” on the navigation bar to begin.” onto the main jumbotron. Then, to stop the page from seeming like it was shouting at you, I lowered the title “The Mushroom Map” to be an h2 instead of an h1. I also used the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;small&gt;</code> tag for the version number within that h2 to apply some built in boot-strappy styling. Separating the heading of that content from the body with an <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;hr /&gt;</code> also gives some breathing room.</p>

<p>Finally, taking after the cards that became popular with Google’s Material Design guidelines, I opted to fashion the jumbotron holding the content as a card with a white background with a slight shadow. Our css file now contains:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
.active-link {
  color: blue;
}

.navbar-bg {
  background-color: white;
}

.card {
  background-color: white;
  box-shadow: 1px 3px 5px 3px rgba(204, 204, 204, 0.3);
}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And the landing page now appears like so:</p>

<p><img class="rounded img-fluid shadow" src="/img/post_images/mushroom_card_index.png" /></p>

<p>Then to soften up the appearance of the links I opted to change the color to a softer shade of blue. Changing the color of the links to be less in your face may seem like a small change, but I’ve repeatedly found that by doings so it makes the page appear more friendly and welcoming.</p>

<p>Our custom file is now:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
.active-link {
  color: blue;
}

.navbar-bg {
  background-color: white;
}

.card {
  background-color: white;
  box-shadow: 1px 3px 5px 3px rgba(204, 204, 204, 0.3);
}

a {
  color: #17a2b8;
}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And the landing page now appears like so:</p>

<p><img class="rounded img-fluid shadow" src="/img/post_images/mushroom_link_color.png" /></p>

<p>Now switching gears to the actual functionality of the site, the original search page looked like the following:</p>

<p><img class="rounded img-fluid shadow" src="/img/post_images/mushroom_original_search.png" /></p>

<p>With the navbar changes that were made before that carried over, and by moving the content into a jumbotron just like before the content now mostly matches the homepage. It’s just a matter of cleaning it up. By making those changes, which doesn’t require a change to the css file, the page looks like so:</p>

<p><img class="rounded img-fluid shadow" src="/img/post_images/mushroom_card_search.png" /></p>

<p>While that form is functional, it would appear better to use the form-groups that bootstrap provides to shape the label and the input. The code to do that is:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
&lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
  &lt;label for="example"&gt;Example&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input class="form-control" name="example" type="text"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And now the page looks like:</p>

<p><img class="rounded img-fluid shadow" src="/img/post_images/mushroom_form_groups.png" /></p>

<p>Then, to take advantage of larger screens I moved the examples over to a second column. Once the screen got below the bootstrap’s defined medium screen size it then converts to being stacked like how it was. It now appears like so on larger screens:</p>

<p>The original search page did alert the user if they had errors entering when submitting the form, however to make the look of the match the original, I modified them to both be alerts with the danger class. The danger class is a built in Bootstrap element that can be added to most text tags that makes the font color red, and in the case of the alerts also makes the background a lighter shade of red to really emphasize the text. A screenshot of the new change is below:</p>

<p><img class="rounded img-fluid shadow" src="/img/post_images/mushroom_alerts.png" /></p>

<p>Next, The example list was modified to be a dictionary list. Like changing the sizes of the card titles, this was done to make the page seem less in your face, while still providing the information. See below for the difference:</p>

<p><img class="rounded img-fluid shadow" src="/img/post_images/mushroom_d_list.png" /></p>

<p>And the last major change was to make the search look better by just adding some padding for mobile. While a minor change, the extra space makes the applications interface flow better.</p>

<p>Our custom file is now:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
.active-link {
  color: blue;
}

.navbar-bg {
  background-color: white;
}

.card {
  background-color: white;
  box-shadow: 1px 3px 5px 3px rgba(204, 204, 204, 0.3);
}

a {
  color: #17a2b8;
}

mobile_padding {
  padding-bottom: 1em;
}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And that padding class is applied to the column containing the search form. The final product looks like below, shown in desktop and phone sized screens.</p>

<p><img class="rounded img-fluid shadow" src="/img/post_images/mushroom_final_desk.png" /></p>

<p><img class="rounded img-fluid shadow" src="/img/post_images/mushroom_final_phone.png" /></p>

      <h4><a href="/writing/2018/01/17/Net-Neutrality-Thoughts.html">Some Thoughts About Net Neutrality</a></h4>
      <p><p>Recently I was asked to answer the below questions as part of the Information
Ethics class that I am taking, and I thought they would stand as a good
representation of my views on Net Neutrality. Enjoy.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Are you in favor of network neutrality going forward? Why or why not?</strong></p>

<p>I am entirely in favor of net neutrality. To believe anything else would be to go against the very essence of what makes the internet so great. The internet, since it was first invented by Tim Berners Lee, has long been a free for all where anyone can make the next big thing out of their garage. For most of the gian companies that we knwo today, i.e. Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, Facebook, and others, are only as big as they are because they were able to thrive as young companies on the internet.</p>

<p>If the protection that these large companies used, that of every end point on the internet being treated equal, ever goes away it will almost certainly guarantee that competition among little companies will all but evaporate as the already established behemoths can simply pay to wipe them out.</p>

<p><strong>What is the threat of ISPs, private business firms, charging whatever they want to charge and that the market will bear?</strong></p>

<p>By charging whatever they feel like charging to certain businesses the ISPs are trying to make their service what it isn’t. The goal of an INTERNET service provider is to provide service, i.e. access, to the internet. It is most certainly NOT to choose what goes over the internet. The role of the ISP is to act as a dumb pipe, the same way that a sewer does not care whether it carries water, excrement, or food shavings. Allowing an ISP to charge more for certain services would be the exact same as allowing sewage companies to charge more to carry water from your toilet than water from your sink.</p>

<p><strong>What do the FCC and industry critics mean by “discriminatory behavior” towards selected Internet services? Does the FCC want to prevent ISPs from managing their networks?</strong></p>

<p>Discriminatory behavior on behalf of the ISPs would be to charge based on the type of traffic that goes over their network. Since a packet of video is no more damaging to a computer network than a packet of plain text, there is no reason that an ISP should be able to charge more for one than the other. The ISP is perfectly allowed to manage their networks, only so far as they are allowed to continue being a dumb pipe.</p>

<p><strong>Does the FCC support metered pricing and/or Internet bandwidth caps?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, as long as the pricing reflects the usage and is non-discriminatory.</p>

<p><strong>Major cities of the world have adopted “congestion pricing” in which cars pay a toll to enter the core of the city during daylight hours. Congestion pricing is also used to regulate demand by businesses for electricity. During the day when electricity is in high demand, many businesses pay a “demand” fee in addition to the regular charge for electricity. Why is the Internet any different?</strong></p>

<p>Well, the internet is different simply because the demand of the internet can be met much more simply than the demands of electricity. While the electricity of the United States has been regulated so everyone gets the same availability. The same is not true for ISPs. There are still multiple places within this country that have less than a 10mbps line as the fastest internet that they can get. Before the ISPs worry about charging their existings customers more and ruining thousands of internet based businesses, they should focus on actually providing the service they are supposed too to their customers.</p>

<p><strong>If your business model depended for its success on millions of people being able to stream videos on demand (like YouTube) would you be in favor of net neutrality or against it?</strong></p>

<p>In favor of it. If my business model is dependant on as many people accessing it as possible, as most internet companies are, any extra charge per customer could be devestating.</p>

      <h4><a href="/writing/2018/01/05/VPN-Necessity.html">VPN, A Necessity?</a></h4>
      <p><p>Is using a VPN a necessecity for all internet users in this day and age? While
it may be a bit extreme, I do believe that any internet user that isn’t using a
VPN for their daily internet usage to protect their privacy and anonymity. There
are many reasons that an internet user should care about their privacy,
especially with the recent proposed change by the United States FCC.</p>

<p>While Internet Service Providers(ISPs) within the United States will soon be
able to charge users more depending on what softwares you actually use within
your billing period, none of that matters if you can’t be tracked. When using a
VPN, the only traffic that your ISP will be able to see and intercept will be to
the domain that hosts your VPN of choice. So while getting to Netflix may cost
you $0.02 a Mb, made up purely for this example but not out of the realms of
possibiity, if standard internet traffic only costs you $0.01 a Mb going through
the VPN which will appear as standard traffic lowers the costs that you will be
facing by half.</p>

<p>Another big use of VPNs is to provide the same functionality of hiding your
traffic from others that may be looking to snoop it on the same network. This is
especially a problem on public WiFi that you may find in hotels, coffee shops,
and increasingly other public areas, as anyone that is on the same network as
you has the ability to see all traffic on this network. Another common issue
that standard internet users may encounter is fake public networks, such as a
mailicious individual that broadcasts an accesible network with the name “Free
Starbucks WiFi” from a computer that they own. Many internet users may connect
to the WiFi without a second thought, but through using a VPN to browse the
internet the malicious individual will not be able to easily see the traffic
that is being generated nor its intended destination.</p>

<p>While these aren’t the only reasons that someone should use a VPN, they are
among the most popular. I do encourage everyone that comes across this post to
seriously evaluate for themselves whether they need a VPN. As to what company to
use for your VPN, that is a matter that I will not step into, instead advising
each person to evaluate the various options on their own.</p>

worked great in the directory where we started the simpleshell, the complicated

      <h4><a href="/writing/2017/12/05/Building-A-Shell-pt-4.html">Building a Shell, Part 4</a></h4>
      <p><p>Now, we’re going to focus on how we would add more complex functions to the
shell. While you can simply keep declaring them as singular functions, when the
built in functionality gets more complex, think listing all files in a
directory, it becomes easier to break each piece of functionality out into it’s
own .c file, compile it as part of the build process, and then execute it from
our shell.</p>

<p>Executing these functions is the perfect use of our child processes, as you
don’t want to clog up the main process performing complex work. The way that you
can execute arbitrary commands from within our shell is through the <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/exec-family-of-functions-in-c/">exec
family</a> of
functions. While that link goes into further detail about the various options,
the one that we’ll be focusing on is the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>int execl(const char *path, const char *arg0, ... /*, (char *)0 */);

// An example of this command
execl("path to command", "command name", "arg1", "arg2", ... , NULL);

// And an actual example
execl("/bin/echo", "echo", "Hello World!", NULL);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we actually ran the code above, our shell would launch the echo command in
the background, pass in the two command line args, in this case the name of the
program and what we want to be echoe’d, and then it would process. In this case
the output would be the string Hello World! While this may seem like a trivial
example, it is in fact very powerful as it allows us to add pretty much any
functions that we want. We’ll dive into a few of those functions tomorrow, but
for now I’ll just add the echo command to our shell. I’ll also add an error
string if the entered command doesn’t exist.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>int main(void) {
    int _continue = 0;
    char *buff = malloc(sizeof(char) * 512);

    do {
        printf("[Command prompt]$ ");

      <p><p>Next, we’ll add a few built in functions to the shell. Our shell will support
printing the current directory, changing the current directory, and quitting as
built in commands. We’ll also be giving the shell the ability to run some
external commands in the next section of this series. The code for each of these
commands is simple, and the quit command was already included last time. So, the
code for printing the current directory:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>int wd(void) {
    char *current_dir;
    allocateStr(&amp;current_dir);
    GUARD_PTR(getcwd(current_dir, MAX_STR));
    puts(current_dir);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And the code for changing the directory:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>int chwd(char *new_path) {
    if (new_path == NULL) {
        printf("The proper usage of %s is %s.\n", "chwd", "chwd pathname");
    } else {
        GUARD(chdir(new_path));
    }
    return 0;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The functions will then be added to the shell like so:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>int main(void) {
    int _continue = 0;
    char *buff = malloc(sizeof(char) * 512);

        buff = getLine(stdin); // uses the getLine from yesterdays post.

        if (strcmp(token, "quit") == 0) {

        } else if (strcmp(token, "chwd") == 0) {

        } else {

            child = fork();

            if (child == 0) {
                puts(buff);
                return 1;
            } else {

      <p><p>This is the second section in a series of posts walking through the steps I took
to make a basic shell for a final project for a systems programming class. The
only thing that we’ll be adding to the
shell today is probably the most important aspect of the shell, the fact that
all of the actions that it does are run in background processes, and the main or
parent process only is responsible for getting input, passing it to the process,
and then getting whatever the process returns. In C, processes are created
through the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/fork">fork</a> system call, and contain an exact
copy of the parent processes memory. This is unfortunately not the place to go
into in depth detail of processes, and that will occur a different day. For now,
an example that runs the printing of the input in a child process, and gets the
input in a parent process would look like so:</p>

    int _continue = 0;

      <h4><a href="/writing/2017/12/02/Building-A-Shell-pt-1.html">Building a Shell, Part 1</a></h4>
      <p><p>This series of posts will walk through the basics of building a shell, based on
bash, in the C programming language. This is the final project for a systems
programming class that I am taking, and I think tracking my progress here will
be beneficial for me to look back on later.</p>

<p>To start out, the first major thing that a shell does is read in input from the
user, in order to parse it to make commands. So, the first thing that we’re
going to do is write a function to read in a line from standard input, stopping
at the first newline encountered. An example of a function that does this could
be the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>char *getLine(FILE* stream) {
    char *line;
    line = malloc(sizeof(char) * 256); // 256 being a decent size for an input string
    char *buff;
    buff = malloc(sizeof(char) * 1);
    int index = 0;

    while (fgets(buff, 2, stream) != NULL) {
        if (*buff == '\n') {
            line[index] = *buff;
            break;
        } else {
            line[index] = *buff;
            index++;
        }
    }

    return line;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then continuing on with the rest of the shell, we need a basic function that
loops through, getting input and doing something with it. This could be a
function as follows:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>int loop(void) {
    
    while (1) {
        // Prompt the user for input with your shell
        printf("[my_shell]$ ");

        char *line;
        line = malloc(sizeof(char) * 256); // 256 being the size we declared in the other function

        line = getLine(stdin);

        puts(line);
    }

    return 0;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above function would currently loop forever, simply prompting for input and
printing that same input back to the user. Tomorrow during the next section of
this series, we’ll cover the fact that all of the commands in a shell are run in
a background process, and how to actually do that.</p>

      <h4><a href="/writing/2017/10/16/Guerilla-Open-Access-Manifesto.html">Guerilla Open Access Manifesto</a></h4>
      <p><p>The following was orginally written by a group of librarians located within
Italy in 2008. It was published by Aaron Swartz on his blog, and was one of the
main things that was being held against him in the prosecution over downloading
JSTOR articles.</p>

<p>The main goal of the manifesto is to provoke those with access to information
that is with-held from the greater public to take the information and share it
to those without access. This relates to the previous article about Thomas
Jefferson, as it once again is a demonstration that information should be free.
By posting this article, I acknowledge that I am sharing my agreement with the
contents. And I also acknowledge that that agreement may be held against me by
future employers and others. So be it. Information wants to be free, and free it
shall be.</p>

<h4 class="text-center">Guerilla Open Access Manifesto</h4>

<p>Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it
for 
themselves. The world’s entire scientific and cultural heritage, published
over centuries 
in books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a
handful of 
private corporations. Want to read the papers featuring the most famous
results of the 
sciences? You’ll need to send enormous amounts to publishers like Reed
Elsevier.</p>

<p>There are those struggling to change this. The Open Access Movement has
fought 
valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but
instead ensure 
their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to
access it. But 
even under the best scenarios, their work will only apply to things
published in the future. 
Everything up until now will have been lost.</p>

<p>That is too high a price to pay. Forcing academics to pay money to read the
work of their 
colleagues? Scanning entire libraries but only allowing the folks at Google
to read them? 
Providing scientific articles to those at elite universities in the First
World, but not to 
children in the Global South? It’s outrageous and unacceptable.</p>

<p>“I agree,” many say, “but what can we do? The companies hold the copyrights,
they 
make enormous amounts of money by charging for access, and it’s perfectly
legal — 
there’s nothing we can do to stop them.” But there is something we can,
something that’s 
already being done: we can fight back.</p>

<p>Those with access to these resources — students, librarians, scientists —
you have been 
given a privilege. You get to feed at this banquet of knowledge while the
rest of the world 
is locked out. But you need not — indeed, morally, you cannot — keep this
privilege for 
yourselves. You have a duty to share it with the world. And you have:
trading passwords 
with colleagues, filling download requests for friends.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, those who have been locked out are not standing idly by. You have
been 
sneaking through holes and climbing over fences, liberating the information
locked up by 
the publishers and sharing them with your friends.</p>

<p>But all of this action goes on in the dark, hidden underground. It’s called
stealing or 
piracy, as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were the moral equivalent of
plundering a 
ship and murdering its crew. But sharing isn’t immoral — it’s a moral
imperative. Only 
those blinded by greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy.</p>

<p>Large corporations, of course, are blinded by greed. The laws under which
they operate 
require it — their shareholders would revolt at anything less. And the
politicians they 
have bought off back them, passing laws giving them the exclusive power to
decide who 
can make copies.</p>

<p>There is no justice in following unjust laws. It’s time to come into the
light and, in the 
grand tradition of civil disobedience, declare our opposition to this
private theft of public 
culture.</p>

<p>We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and
share them with 
the world. We need to take stuff that’s out of copyright and add it to the
archive. We need 
to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download
scientific 
journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for
Guerilla Open 
Access.</p>

<p>With enough of us, around the world, we’ll not just send a strong message
opposing the 
privatization of knowledge — we’ll make it a thing of the past. Will you
join us?</p>

two libraries that I’ll be working on shortly, and might look to implement it in
some open source libraries I’ve been thinking of implementing.</p>

      <h4><a href="/writing/2017/10/12/Progressive-Thoughts-Not-So.html">Progressive Views Not So</a></h4>
      <p><p>Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States, 
once wrote a
<a href="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_8s12.html">letter</a> 
to his friend Isaac McPherson regarding the state
of intellectual freedom within the United States at the time. Jefferson’s views
would be considered progressive today, yet invoke lots of thought when read with
the context of when he was alive.</p>

<p>Jefferson’s thoughts, while comprehensive can be summed up as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>By their very nature, ideas cannot be property.</li>
  <li>The government has no duty to make laws about them.</li>
  <li>The laws that we do make are far from successful.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thomas Jefferson was very for the concept of ideas being a fact of nature, and
just like all other facets of nature ideas want to be free. A simple example of
this is if person A has an idea. Now, this person can never tell anyone of their
idea thus keeping it “safe”. However, once they decide to share that idea with
person B that idea can be their own no more. Why? Well, even if person B agrees,
through a legal document or otherwise, that they will never use the information
contained within the idea and that they will never base a new idea off of the
previous one, it is basically impossible to follow through with that promise.
Once someone hears about and understands an idea then that idea will be with
them forever.</p>

<p>That is one of the great parts of sharing ideas, that all future inventions are
founded on the ideas that came before. A simple example of this is how many
fewer technologies we would have today if everyone that wanted to program a
website or mobile phone app had to re-invent the convention of electricity or
build their own computer factory. You may be laughing, but that is how many
industries try to treat technology, but more on that another time.</p>

<p>Why should the government not make laws about ideas? Simply because they refuse
to acknowledge that ideas cannot both be shared and property. Going back to last
post, the whole concept of property is zero sum, i.e. in order for something to
be property it must be lost to one owner if it is moved to another. This simply
is not the case when it comes to ideas, or as the government insists on calling
them intellectual property. If you tell me how to make a piece of software, such
as how to make a button look a certain way on a website, then we both have this
knowledge. You don’t suddenly lose the knowledge of how to do it after I learn
how to. Thus ideas are not property.</p>

<p>Finally, even if ideas were to be considered property, the laws that the
government makes are far from successful due to a few factors. The first being
that the punishments are far from just. Like how there’s a sliding scale in how
long prison sentences are based on the crimme, there needs to be a sliding scale
in the way that we punish these “criminals”. If we try to insist that the person
that physically robs a store at gun point and the person that clicks download on
a website deserve equal sentences then we are destined to fail especially
considering the second is essentially a crime without a victim. Secondly, it is
unfair to equivocate the effects that these laws have on the various types of
intellectual property. Under the current laws, the punishment is the same
whether you are copying Amazon’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Click">one-click</a> patent or a simple catchy
tune from a commercial advertisement. It doesn’t take much thought to
acknowledge that these two should probably be treated differently.</p>

<p>It’s fascinating to me that thinking along these lines is today associated with
dumb youngsters who are used to downloading everything online, when this line of
thinking have been with us for hundreds of years.</p>

      <h4><a href="/writing/2017/09/15/Listing-Users.html"># of Users Logged In</a></h4>
      <p><p>While going through the Unix Systems Programming book, one of the preface
questions asked to devise a one line command to list the number of users
currently logged in to my system. Here’s how to do that.</p>

<p>My first instict was to go to the man pages, and then quickly found out that
the man pages don’t really help if you don’t know the name of the program you’re
looking at. So I then looked in my /bin/ directory, which contained about 25
various system utilities.</p>

<p>However nothing in there looked useful. I then checked in the /usr/bin directory,
which contained something called <code class="highlighter-rouge">users</code>. Now, we might be getting somewhere.
Looking at the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/users">man page</a> for the command, it
looks like this is exactly what we want. So we simply need to run a command like
so: <code class="highlighter-rouge">users | wc -w</code> which counts the number of words that are output by the
users command, where each word is the name of a logged in user. Problem solved.</p>
