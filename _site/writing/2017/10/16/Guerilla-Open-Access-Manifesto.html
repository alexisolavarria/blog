                  <p>The following was orginally written by a group of librarians located within
Italy in 2008. It was published by Aaron Swartz on his blog, and was one of the
main things that was being held against him in the prosecution over downloading
JSTOR articles.</p>

<p>The main goal of the manifesto is to provoke those with access to information
that is with-held from the greater public to take the information and share it
to those without access. This relates to the previous article about Thomas
Jefferson, as it once again is a demonstration that information should be free.
By posting this article, I acknowledge that I am sharing my agreement with the
contents. And I also acknowledge that that agreement may be held against me by
future employers and others. So be it. Information wants to be free, and free it
shall be.</p>

<h4 class="text-center">Guerilla Open Access Manifesto</h4>

<p>Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it
for
themselves. The world’s entire scientific and cultural heritage, published
over centuries
in books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a
handful of
private corporations. Want to read the papers featuring the most famous
results of the
sciences? You’ll need to send enormous amounts to publishers like Reed
Elsevier.</p>

<p>There are those struggling to change this. The Open Access Movement has
fought
valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but
instead ensure
their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to
access it. But
even under the best scenarios, their work will only apply to things
published in the future.
Everything up until now will have been lost.</p>

<p>That is too high a price to pay. Forcing academics to pay money to read the
work of their
colleagues? Scanning entire libraries but only allowing the folks at Google
to read them?
Providing scientific articles to those at elite universities in the First
World, but not to
children in the Global South? It’s outrageous and unacceptable.</p>

<p>“I agree,” many say, “but what can we do? The companies hold the copyrights,
they
make enormous amounts of money by charging for access, and it’s perfectly
legal —
there’s nothing we can do to stop them.” But there is something we can,
something that’s
already being done: we can fight back.</p>

<p>Those with access to these resources — students, librarians, scientists —
you have been
given a privilege. You get to feed at this banquet of knowledge while the
rest of the world
is locked out. But you need not — indeed, morally, you cannot — keep this
privilege for
yourselves. You have a duty to share it with the world. And you have:
trading passwords
with colleagues, filling download requests for friends.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, those who have been locked out are not standing idly by. You have
been
sneaking through holes and climbing over fences, liberating the information
locked up by
the publishers and sharing them with your friends.</p>

<p>But all of this action goes on in the dark, hidden underground. It’s called
stealing or
piracy, as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were the moral equivalent of
plundering a
ship and murdering its crew. But sharing isn’t immoral — it’s a moral
imperative. Only
those blinded by greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy.</p>

<p>Large corporations, of course, are blinded by greed. The laws under which
they operate
require it — their shareholders would revolt at anything less. And the
politicians they
have bought off back them, passing laws giving them the exclusive power to
decide who
can make copies.</p>

<p>There is no justice in following unjust laws. It’s time to come into the
light and, in the
grand tradition of civil disobedience, declare our opposition to this
private theft of public
culture.</p>

<p>We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and
share them with
the world. We need to take stuff that’s out of copyright and add it to the
archive. We need
to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download
scientific
journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for
Guerilla Open
Access.</p>

<p>With enough of us, around the world, we’ll not just send a strong message
opposing the
privatization of knowledge — we’ll make it a thing of the past. Will you
join us?</p>
