                    <p class="lead card-text"><p>Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States, 
once wrote a
<a href="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_8s12.html">letter</a> 
to his friend Isaac McPherson regarding the state
of intellectual freedom within the United States at the time. Jefferson’s views
would be considered progressive today, yet invoke lots of thought when read with
the context of when he was alive.</p>

<p>Jefferson’s thoughts, while comprehensive can be summed up as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>By their very nature, ideas cannot be property.</li>
  <li>The government has no duty to make laws about them.</li>
  <li>The laws that we do make are far from successful.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thomas Jefferson was very for the concept of ideas being a fact of nature, and
just like all other facets of nature ideas want to be free. A simple example of
this is if person A has an idea. Now, this person can never tell anyone of their
idea thus keeping it “safe”. However, once they decide to share that idea with
person B that idea can be their own no more. Why? Well, even if person B agrees,
through a legal document or otherwise, that they will never use the information
contained within the idea and that they will never base a new idea off of the
previous one, it is basically impossible to follow through with that promise.
Once someone hears about and understands an idea then that idea will be with
them forever.</p>

<p>That is one of the great parts of sharing ideas, that all future inventions are
founded on the ideas that came before. A simple example of this is how many
fewer technologies we would have today if everyone that wanted to program a
website or mobile phone app had to re-invent the convention of electricity or
build their own computer factory. You may be laughing, but that is how many
industries try to treat technology, but more on that another time.</p>

<p>Why should the government not make laws about ideas? Simply because they refuse
to acknowledge that ideas cannot both be shared and property. Going back to last
post, the whole concept of property is zero sum, i.e. in order for something to
be property it must be lost to one owner if it is moved to another. This simply
is not the case when it comes to ideas, or as the government insists on calling
them intellectual property. If you tell me how to make a piece of software, such
as how to make a button look a certain way on a website, then we both have this
knowledge. You don’t suddenly lose the knowledge of how to do it after I learn
how to. Thus ideas are not property.</p>

<p>Finally, even if ideas were to be considered property, the laws that the
government makes are far from successful due to a few factors. The first being
that the punishments are far from just. Like how there’s a sliding scale in how
long prison sentences are based on the crimme, there needs to be a sliding scale
in the way that we punish these “criminals”. If we try to insist that the person
that physically robs a store at gun point and the person that clicks download on
a website deserve equal sentences then we are destined to fail especially
considering the second is essentially a crime without a victim. Secondly, it is
unfair to equivocate the effects that these laws have on the various types of
intellectual property. Under the current laws, the punishment is the same
whether you are copying Amazon’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Click">one-click</a> patent or a simple catchy
tune from a commercial advertisement. It doesn’t take much thought to
acknowledge that these two should probably be treated differently.</p>

<p>It’s fascinating to me that thinking along these lines is today associated with
dumb youngsters who are used to downloading everything online, when this line of
thinking have been with us for hundreds of years.</p>
