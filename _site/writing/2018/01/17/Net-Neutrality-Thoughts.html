                <p>Recently I was asked to answer the below questions as part of the Information
Ethics class that I am taking, and I thought they would stand as a good
representation of my views on Net Neutrality. Enjoy.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Are you in favor of network neutrality going forward? Why or why not?</strong></p>

<p>I am entirely in favor of net neutrality. To believe anything else would be to go against the very essence of what makes the internet so great. The internet, since it was first invented by Tim Berners Lee, has long been a free for all where anyone can make the next big thing out of their garage. For most of the gian companies that we knwo today, i.e. Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, Facebook, and others, are only as big as they are because they were able to thrive as young companies on the internet.</p>

<p>If the protection that these large companies used, that of every end point on the internet being treated equal, ever goes away it will almost certainly guarantee that competition among little companies will all but evaporate as the already established behemoths can simply pay to wipe them out.</p>

<p><strong>What is the threat of ISPs, private business firms, charging whatever they want to charge and that the market will bear?</strong></p>

<p>By charging whatever they feel like charging to certain businesses the ISPs are trying to make their service what it isn’t. The goal of an INTERNET service provider is to provide service, i.e. access, to the internet. It is most certainly NOT to choose what goes over the internet. The role of the ISP is to act as a dumb pipe, the same way that a sewer does not care whether it carries water, excrement, or food shavings. Allowing an ISP to charge more for certain services would be the exact same as allowing sewage companies to charge more to carry water from your toilet than water from your sink.</p>

<p><strong>What do the FCC and industry critics mean by “discriminatory behavior” towards selected Internet services? Does the FCC want to prevent ISPs from managing their networks?</strong></p>

<p>Discriminatory behavior on behalf of the ISPs would be to charge based on the type of traffic that goes over their network. Since a packet of video is no more damaging to a computer network than a packet of plain text, there is no reason that an ISP should be able to charge more for one than the other. The ISP is perfectly allowed to manage their networks, only so far as they are allowed to continue being a dumb pipe.</p>

<p><strong>Does the FCC support metered pricing and/or Internet bandwidth caps?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, as long as the pricing reflects the usage and is non-discriminatory.</p>

<p><strong>Major cities of the world have adopted “congestion pricing” in which cars pay a toll to enter the core of the city during daylight hours. Congestion pricing is also used to regulate demand by businesses for electricity. During the day when electricity is in high demand, many businesses pay a “demand” fee in addition to the regular charge for electricity. Why is the Internet any different?</strong></p>

<p>Well, the internet is different simply because the demand of the internet can be met much more simply than the demands of electricity. While the electricity of the United States has been regulated so everyone gets the same availability. The same is not true for ISPs. There are still multiple places within this country that have less than a 10mbps line as the fastest internet that they can get. Before the ISPs worry about charging their existings customers more and ruining thousands of internet based businesses, they should focus on actually providing the service they are supposed too to their customers.</p>

<p><strong>If your business model depended for its success on millions of people being able to stream videos on demand (like YouTube) would you be in favor of net neutrality or against it?</strong></p>

<p>In favor of it. If my business model is dependant on as many people accessing it as possible, as most internet companies are, any extra charge per customer could be devestating.</p>
