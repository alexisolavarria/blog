allows one to download a youtube video into either an mp3 or mp4 file. While I’m
sure anyone browsing Github can easily run the youtube-dl script yourself, this
is built for you to offer a solution for friends or family members. There are
many sites that offer the same functionality, but they are normally covered in
ads and links to not so great sites, so you can host this one on your personal
network to allow them to go to a trusted resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://converter.doug-skinner.com&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Written as a simple Flask application, it can either be run locally after
installing the required packages, or it is tested to run on a Centos 7 server.
An install script is included to make setup easier on a server. Hosting your own
copy of the software on a Centos 7 server is easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Setup the Centos 7 server&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run the following commands as root
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;yum install git -y&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;git clone https://github.com/doug-skinner/converter.git&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;cd converter&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;./install.sh&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After that script runs, you should be all set by navigating to the ip address of
the server.&lt;/li&gt;

Python (shocking I know) that reads in a regex string and the file to search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than using the built in regex class/parser, Prex then creates a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton&quot;&gt;DFA&lt;/a&gt; from the
input regex string, to allow the regex to be processed. After reading in the
input file, separated line by line on newline characters (‘\n’), the script then
feeds in each line to the internal DFA character by character. If the DFA
reaches the end state, it then returns the starting index, ending index, and all
characters that match the regex printing that info to stdout.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Projects" /><summary type="html">The Python Reguler Expression handler is a basic script written in Python (shocking I know) that reads in a regex string and the file to search.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Flask Template</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/projects/2018/01/23/flask-template.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Flask Template" /><published>2018-01-23T12:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-01-23T12:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/projects/2018/01/23/flask-template</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/projects/2018/01/23/flask-template.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is still a work in progress&lt;/strong&gt;.

attractive for users, allowing it’s content to be more easily understood, and
flow better among various screen sizes. The previous website had the content,
however it was laid out in lack luster way, and was optimized for desktop while
being almost unusable on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Straying from my usual design patterns, which closely blend standard bootstrap
elements with the flatter aspects of the material design guidelines by Google, I
chose to keep the site almost entirely native bootstrap, using a darker theme to
align with the original site. The site consists of three main pages: a basic
landing page utilizing rows and columns to layout content, an about page that
contains a manifesto from the company owner, and a page that contains reviews of
the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The page was created using the Jekyll static site generating framework, is
hosted on a Centos 7 server being served by the Apache webserver, and is located
behind an Nginx load-balancer also running on a Centos 7 server. The TLS
ertificate for the site is provided by Let’s Encrypt, and is also being served
by the Nginx load-balancer. The repo for the site can be found my personal
Gitlab, &lt;a href=&quot;http://gitlab.doug-skinner.com/root/restassured&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Projects" /><summary type="html">The website for Rest Assured Home Inspections LLC was redesigned to make it more attractive for users, allowing it’s content to be more easily understood, and flow better among various screen sizes.
