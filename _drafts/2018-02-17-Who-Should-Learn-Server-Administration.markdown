So, I've been asked by a few people both at work and school about who should learn server administration. While I am by no means an expert at administrating servers, I do keep a healthy homelab of between fifteen and twenty servers and I help maintain roughly the same amount of servers here at my day job so I do have some basic knowledge. I will try to outline a few people who should look into this, and also a few reasons as to why they should.

The first group of people that may be curious about server administration are those who are looking to either switch careers from something else into server administration or those who are looking to make the jump from help desk, or related, to being an administrator. While being a server administrator is not the easiest role in the world, knowing the basics is certainly doable for the average person interested in technology. The second group of people would be developers looking to launch a website or other online service, maybe a server component for a mobile application or related, and wish to have control over where that will be hosted.

By following the path of becoming a server administrator one will gain a basic understanding of how the internet operates, as each and every website that you visit throughout the day is run by technologies that are roughly the same as what you will be learning. Once you have learned this information yourself, it will be easy for you to apply among any number of uses, whether that be a virtual machine on your laptop or desktop or even on a hosted virtual private server (VPS) hosted at a hosting provider. The only difference between the two are where the machine is located.

For those simply looking to become server administrators, that means that this knowledge will be easily transferrable among any company that you wish to work for. Those developers looking to launch their own site will reap greater benefit as it will allow you to host your site with any hosting provider, so you can jump between them until you find the right mix of price and customer support as you see fit. This lack of provider tie in becomes even more important when the developer realizes that they don't have to host everything under the sun with AWS. There is nothing wrong with hosting services on AWS, but one can normally save time, money and stress by being able to host their site on any old box that runs linux.

I am continually amazed by the amount of classmates that I talk to that don't even realize there is another option to hosting a website that isn't on the platform provided by AWS. They are even more amazed to learn how simply having one load balancer and two web servers behind it sets them up to scale almost infinitely for a time. While there are limitations to that, trust me by the time that you hit them you should easily be making enough money from your site or service that upgrading from that setup can be the problem of someone that you hire.

Considering the above benefits of learning a new skill for career advancement or ease of launching a new project, for anyone even thinking about starting to learn server administration the answer should be a resounding yes. Over the next few days and weeks I'll be putting together a series of posts that will allow one to begin the path of server administration by starting with a blank VPS and getting to the point of having a secure one page website. Now, what can one do with one page site? They can have it be a simple resume site, or even turn it into a bunch of pages kind of like the blog that you are currently reading. Neat, huh?
