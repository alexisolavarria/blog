The Information Collection will be an online archive of all works that I
reference on this site and in other aspects of my life. This will include pdfs,
epubs, downloaded articles, and anything else that I come across. The site will
be live 10/18/2017 with the first pieces of content ready to go then. The url of
the site will be [/library](/library.html) hosted directly off of this blog.
