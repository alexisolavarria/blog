It's done. It took a rough 85 line Python script to do, and lots of anger at UTF-8 encodings, but it is done. There is now a full record of all of the blog posts of Aaron Swartz, here hosted on my site. The archive of the posts can be found [here](https://www.doug-skinner.com/raw_thoughts_archive.html). If there are any questions about it please email me at the contact address below, and if there is any interest in the script then I can certainly post about it.
