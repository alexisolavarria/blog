While many have thought it previously, it is always worth bringing up again that
having collections of knowledge that are easily accessible are of such necessity
that it is irresponsible for an individual that has information not to share it.

While I am most certainly not vain enough to consider anything that I create
so important that it needs to be archived, I do think that most resources I use
for my various projects and classed are. So, I will be creating an online
collection of resources that will be freely available. This will be hosted
here on this site, under the [/library](/library.html) url. The resources will
be categorized based on how I use them, and more information can be found
[here](/projects/2017/10/17/Information-Collection.html). The site will be live
as of tomorrow (10/18/2017).
