__This is still a work in progress__. This project aims to be a template for other web developers to base their
projects off of. The template includes a couple of classes that handle creating
users, logging in users, and eventually managing users. Each user upon logging
in is presented with their own control panel for whatever service they are
logging into. 

As stated above, this project is a work in progress, and I will be posting updates below as they happen, and updating through blog posts.
