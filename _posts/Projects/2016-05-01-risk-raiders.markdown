The Risk Raiders website was developed during an internship with Ernst & Young my sophomore year, in order to allow financial firms to more easily control their Third Party Risk Management. Third Party Risk Management is one of the most crucial aspects of the relationship between a financial institution and the various third party vendors that they work with.

This is because allowing a third party access to a financial institutions business critical information, servers, and software requires the financial institution to trust the third party entirely. This trust stems from the financial institution following a standardized cycle for forming a new third party relationship. This cycle follows the creation and eventual ending of the relationship between the two parties, and consists of five phases. The phases, in the order that they occur are planning, due diligence, contract negotiation, monitoring, and finally termination.

When forming a new third party relationship, the third party invariably introduces risk to the financial institution. This risk can be anything that could negatively impact the financial institutions profit, current reputation, relationships with other institutions, or business longevity. The risk that is there at the start of the relationship is what's known as inherent risk. This risk can be very high or very low depending on how well the third party has mitigated this risk. Even though the third party may have lowered the risk, it is still the responsibility of the financial institution to try to lower this risk even further. The financial institution does this by placing controls on the relationship between the two parties. Once these controls are in place most of the inherent risk should be removed. The risk that is left over after the controls are put into place is considered the residual risk.

The functionality of the website was such that a member of the financial firm could log into a web interface and view a matrix of scores of the various third parties that they are partnered with. This allows the financial firm to quickly assess all of their relationships and make decisions based upon them.

This project was my first major entry into web development, and consisted of a Python Flask backend with a front-end utilizing in JQuery. The database layer is MySQL. It was hosted on a web server that I ran, running Centos 7.
