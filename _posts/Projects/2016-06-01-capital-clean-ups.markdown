The Capital Clean Ups website was created for a small business in my local area that focuses on removing junk from commercial and residential locations. It was primarily used to advertise that the company existed, and also to showcase the services offered. Overall, it was a very basic website and done more as a favor than as a learning experience.

~~This project was my second major entry into web development, and consisted of a Python Flask backend with a front-end mostly in JQuery. The database layer is MySQL. It was hosted on a web server that I ran, running Centos 7.~~

Just kidding. This project has since been updated to use bootstrap 4 and is
generated using Jekyll. No more database or flask for a 5 page static site.
Still hosted by me on a Centos 7 server.
