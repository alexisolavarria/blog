The **P**ython **R**eguler **Ex**pression handler is a basic script written in
Python (shocking I know) that reads in a regex string and the file to search. 

Rather than using the built in regex class/parser, Prex then creates a
[DFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton) from the
input regex string, to allow the regex to be processed. After reading in the
input file, separated line by line on newline characters ('\n'), the script then
feeds in each line to the internal DFA character by character. If the DFA
reaches the end state, it then returns the starting index, ending index, and all
characters that match the regex printing that info to stdout.
