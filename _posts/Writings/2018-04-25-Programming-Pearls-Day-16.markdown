Okay, continuing on to day fifteen, the text of the problem is: 

__Several readers pointed out that while all three rotation algorithms require
time proportional to n, the juggling algorithm is apparently twice as fast as
the reversal algorithm: it stores and retrieves each element of the array just
once, while the reversal algorithm does so twice. Experiment with the functions
to compare their speeds on real machines; be especially sensitive to issues
surrounding the locality of memory references.__

My solution is below:

Skipping this one, as all three solutions run fast enough on my machine.

{% endhighlight python %}
