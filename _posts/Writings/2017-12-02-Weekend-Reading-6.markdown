Weekend reading part seven, [Tutorial, Write a shell in
C](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/), was read before
attempting to complete the task, building a basic shell, for one of my classes.
I'll be going through this task in a series of posts over the next couple of
days, in order to track my progress with it.
