Weekend reading part one, [Recursive Make Considered
Harmful](/uploads/recursive_make_considered_harmful.pdf)
, is the first in a weekly series of postings about
topics that I enjoyed reading about followed by a short commentary.

This week we delve into the topic of efficient makefiles, and why using a
recursive make build is detrimental to most projects. I'll be using this for the
two libraries that I'll be working on shortly, and might look to implement it in
some open source libraries I've been thinking of implementing.
