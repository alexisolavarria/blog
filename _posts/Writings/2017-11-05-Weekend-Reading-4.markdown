Weekend reading part four, [When Is Transparency
Useful](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/usefultransparency)
, takes a different turn from the past few readings. It's an essay by the late
Aaron Swartz that explores why transparency in the government is a nice goal to
have, but also explains why it may not do what those who push for it believe
that it will.
