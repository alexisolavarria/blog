Early this morning I was browsing my own site, and felt that the white was a
little too harsh on the eyes. So, I spent a couple minutes implementing dark
mode, and turning it on by default upon page load. To switch back to the lighter
style, simply toggle the button in the navbar. Right now, you will also have to
toggle the light mode switch on every page, as I haven't implemented the cookies
required to make it permanent. Maybe next week.
