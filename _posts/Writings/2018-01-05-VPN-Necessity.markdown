Is using a VPN a necessecity for all internet users in this day and age? While
it may be a bit extreme, I do believe that any internet user that isn't using a
VPN for their daily internet usage to protect their privacy and anonymity. There
are many reasons that an internet user should care about their privacy,
especially with the recent proposed change by the United States FCC.

While Internet Service Providers(ISPs) within the United States will soon be
able to charge users more depending on what softwares you actually use within
your billing period, none of that matters if you can't be tracked. When using a
VPN, the only traffic that your ISP will be able to see and intercept will be to
the domain that hosts your VPN of choice. So while getting to Netflix may cost
you $0.02 a Mb, made up purely for this example but not out of the realms of
possibiity, if standard internet traffic only costs you $0.01 a Mb going through
the VPN which will appear as standard traffic lowers the costs that you will be
facing by half. 

Another big use of VPNs is to provide the same functionality of hiding your
traffic from others that may be looking to snoop it on the same network. This is
especially a problem on public WiFi that you may find in hotels, coffee shops,
and increasingly other public areas, as anyone that is on the same network as
you has the ability to see all traffic on this network. Another common issue
that standard internet users may encounter is fake public networks, such as a
mailicious individual that broadcasts an accesible network with the name "Free
Starbucks WiFi" from a computer that they own. Many internet users may connect
to the WiFi without a second thought, but through using a VPN to browse the
internet the malicious individual will not be able to easily see the traffic
that is being generated nor its intended destination.

While these aren't the only reasons that someone should use a VPN, they are
among the most popular. I do encourage everyone that comes across this post to
seriously evaluate for themselves whether they need a VPN. As to what company to
use for your VPN, that is a matter that I will not step into, instead advising
each person to evaluate the various options on their own.
