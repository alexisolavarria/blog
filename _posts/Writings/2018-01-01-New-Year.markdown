Another year, another chance to make declarations about the goals that one hopes
to accomplish in the next 365 days. Writing down goals, especially in a semi
public place such as the internet, is one of the major steps to take in ensuring
that those goals actually succeed. Well, this is mine, in no particular order.

* Post here on this blog a major post at least once a week.
* Release a new project or big update for a project every month.
* Post a picture that I'm proud of every week.

By the end of this month I should be able to see if all of these goals actually
come to fruition, and will make any adjustments as needed.
