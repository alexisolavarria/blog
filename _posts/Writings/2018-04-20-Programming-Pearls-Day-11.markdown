Okay, continuing on to day eleven, the text of the problem is: 

__In the early 1980's Lockheed engineers transmitted daily a dozen drawings from
a Computer Aided Design (CAD) system in their Sunnyvale, California, plant to a
test station in Santa Cruz. Although the facilities were just 25 miles apart, an
automobile courier service took over an hour (due to traffic jams and mountain
roads) and cost a hundred dollars per day. Propose alternative data transmission
schemes and estimate their cost.__

The most straight forward, although unusual solution seems to be carrier
pigeons. The birds can be trained to go from one plant to another, and as long
as the CAD drawings can be folded small enough to be transported there seems to
be minimal issues that could occur. Cost unknown, as I am not a carrier pigeon
salesman and do not know one.
