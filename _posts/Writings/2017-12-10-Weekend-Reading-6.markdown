Weekend reading part six, [Design for Developers](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/12/mistakes-developers-make-when-learning-design/)
, is a must read for any developer that feels like their
design is somewhat lacking, but doesn't know where to
start in order to resolve the issue. It walks you through
where to go from where you are, and was helpful in my
design journey.
